# Color scheme quality (light + dark mode)

Treat light/dark mode QA as **non-optional** for every UI change.

## Required modes to check
- Light mode: default scheme (no overrides)
- Dark mode: `prefers-color-scheme: dark` (and any in-app theme toggle, if present)

## Must-haves (never ship without)
- Text contrast is readable: body, headings, captions, and muted text all meet contrast expectations against their backgrounds.
- Interactive states are visible: hover/active/focus/disabled styles work in **both** modes (including focus rings).
- Links look like links: visited/hover states remain distinguishable and readable.
- Borders/dividers show up: subtle lines don’t disappear (especially on dark surfaces).
- Shadows/glows behave: elevation doesn’t invert (no “muddy” shadows in dark mode; no neon glows in light mode unless intentional).
- Icons/SVGs are legible: strokes/fills don’t vanish; avoid hardcoded black-only or white-only icons unless you also theme them.
- Images/media don’t break the UI: transparent PNGs, logos, and screenshots remain visible on both backgrounds (use a container/backplate when needed).
- No “invisible” UI: placeholders, helper text, form labels, error/success states, and empty states are all clearly visible.
- No hardcoded theme-unsafe colors: avoid fixed `text-black` / `bg-white` / raw hex values unless they are intentional and validated in both modes.

## Implementation guidance (Tailwind / Next.js)
- Prefer semantic tokens/variables: use `text-foreground`, `bg-background`, `border-border`, etc. (or your project’s equivalents) over ad-hoc colors.
- When using Tailwind colors, provide dark variants: e.g. `text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-100`, `bg-white dark:bg-slate-950`.
- For translucent surfaces (glass/overlays), tune both: `bg-white/.. dark:bg-slate-900/..` and verify readability on top.
- Ensure focus styles aren’t color-dependent: keep a strong `focus-visible:ring-*` that contrasts in both modes.
