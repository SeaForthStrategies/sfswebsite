# Perfect formatting + alignment (non-negotiable)

## Formatting (code)

- Run `pnpm format` after any UI/code edits; ensure `pnpm format:check` passes before considering work “done”.
- Keep JSX/TSX props clean and consistent:
  - Prefer clear wrapping over dense one-liners once near the print width.
  - Keep related props grouped (e.g., `href/target/rel`, `className`, `aria-*`).
- Tailwind class order must be sorted by Prettier Tailwind plugin output (do not hand-reorder unless it matches formatter output).
- Avoid “almost aligned” markup:
  - Consistent indentation (2 spaces).
  - No trailing whitespace.
  - One blank line between major logical blocks.

## Alignment (UI)

- Use the site container consistently: `container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`.
- Align section content to a shared grid:
  - Use `max-w-*` constraints for readable line lengths.
  - Ensure headings/CTAs line up across sections at desktop breakpoints.
- Keep spacing systemized:
  - Prefer a small set of vertical paddings/margins (e.g., `py-16 md:py-24`, `mt-6`, `gap-6/8/10`).
  - Avoid arbitrary one-off spacing unless there is a clear visual need.
- No accidental misalignment:
  - Avoid fixed heights; use content-driven layout.
  - Watch for wrapped CTAs, uneven grid rows, and off-center elements.
